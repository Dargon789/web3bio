Web5.bio is a Web3 and Web 2.0 identity search service which is powered by [Next.ID](https://next.id). Web5.bio will provide a list of relevant identities when you are searching any Twitter handle, Ethereum address, or ENS domain. 

We're gradually making updates to Web5.bio. You may expect new features and data sources.
